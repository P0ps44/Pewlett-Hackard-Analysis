# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to use the SQL to organize and determine the number of employees that were retiring soon. 
After compiling that database, the next step was to figure out all the employees that were eligible for the mentorship Program.    

## Results

The company will be in a lot of troble if it doesn't address the significant amount of employees retiring soon. It was found that:
- The ratio between employess retiring and empolyees possibly entering a mentorship is astounding.
- Two thirds of the retiring staff are senior level employees.
- Only 2 managers are retiring soon. 
- Currently, no managers are in the mentoring program.

Below is simple, but alarming graph.

## Summary
       
After completing this project, its concluded that the company should start hiring more senior level employees and add more current staff 
to the mentorship program. I found this extra data by compiling the mentorship data into a smaller table call mid in this Data folder github.
